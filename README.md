## Abstract

This paper offers a new interpretation of the double-slit experiment using the Density-Driven Internal Contraction (DDIC) framework. According to DDIC, spacetime behaves as a dynamic lattice whose microstructure contracts in response to localized energy, entropy, and information density. In this view, the act of measurement during the double-slit experiment induces a localized topological collapse, providing a physical explanation for the transition from interference patterns to particle-like trajectories. The paper further explores the relationship between this collapse mechanism and quantum phenomena such as observer dependence, delayed-choice experiments, and Bell-type inequalities, suggesting that quantum measurement outcomes reflect changes in the structural state of spacetime itself.
