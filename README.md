## Abstract

The double-slit experiment reveals quantum mechanics’ measurement paradox, where observation collapses wave-like interference into particle-like patterns, hinting at a fundamental role for observation in shaping reality. The Density-Driven Internal Contraction (DDIC) model reinterprets this collapse as a topological process: a measurement-induced energy density surge triggers microcell contraction, severing phase-coherent pathways and reducing multi-path interference to a single trajectory. The DDIC model provides a deterministic, physically grounded mechanism, linking observation to spacetime’s microstructural dynamics, while preserving free will by avoiding superdeterministic assumptions. The model aligns with quantum gravity frameworks like Loop Quantum Gravity and ER=EPR, offering novel insights into quantum information, free will, and cosmogenesis.
